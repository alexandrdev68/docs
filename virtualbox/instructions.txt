For share folder from host OS (main OS on your PC) to guest Ubuntu OS (OS on VM):
   1. setup Guest Additions (maybe on your ubuntu)
        i am setup guest additions in my ubuntu guest OS:
            
            sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
            
            sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils
            
            restart virtual machine.
            
    2. Share your host OS folder (right click on folder and select "share" in "Properties" menu on Windows).
    3. Open Shared Folders Settings menu item on your VirtualBox top menu (Devices->Shared Folders->Shared Folders Settings...)
        and click on "Adds new shared" icon -> select your shared host OS folder in popup.
        check "Auto-mount" and "Permanent" items. It should automatically be mounted to /media/USER/sf_ShareName or /media/sf_ShareName, depending on your guest OS
        
    4. Add your regular Ubuntu user to the vboxsf group.

            usermod -aG vboxsf <youruser>
    
        If you want a 'better' link under your user's home directory, you could always create a symbolic link.

            ln -s /media/sf_Ubuntu /home/m/Desktop/vbox_shared
    
    You will need to reboot your VM for these changes to take effect
